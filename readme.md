This is my sketchpad/etch-a-sketch project that I've done following The Odin Project workshop.

When the cursor passes over the grid, each square gets colored in black. The RGB Mode button allows to randomize the colors, while the eraser, well, it erases. There's also a button to reset the grid to it's white starting state and a button to set the grid size. The lighten button decreases the opacity of the color in 10% increments, while the darken button does the opposite.

TO-DO LIST:
- make the darken button work even on white squares (don't know how yet)
- add a visual element so the user can tell which modifiers are active
